# Pomodoro Timer ⏱️🍅

A Pomodoro-based timer application built with **React** to help users improve focus and productivity using the Pomodoro Technique.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a web application that implements the **Pomodoro Technique**, a time management method that alternates periods of focused work with short breaks. The application allows users to start, pause, reset, and track focus sessions in a simple and intuitive interface.

The main goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate modern **React** concepts, clean component architecture, state management with Context API, and responsive styling.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** – Component-based UI library  
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server  
- **React Context API** – Global state management  
- **React Router** – Client-side routing  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework  

## ✨ Features

- Pomodoro timer with focus and break cycles  
- Start, pause, and reset timer controls  
- Global state management using Context API  
- Page navigation using React Router  
- Responsive and modern UI with Tailwind CSS  

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
